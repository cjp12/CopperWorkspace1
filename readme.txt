Hello people of Copper,

I've built this program to show that I am deadset on getting this accounting/finance job.
As a CPA versed in python and information technology, I've pulled together a quick demo of market sizing using census bureau population data, unsecured debt csv's, and google trends.
Dedicated to cut my teeth in the start-up space, I very much hope to get an interview.
